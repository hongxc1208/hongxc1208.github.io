\
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Inspiration </h2>\
  \
\
<p style="text-align:center;">Inspired the Virtual Reality game Beat Saber, which the player cutting the music note to win score. I want to explore and make a music-related Augmented Reality game. Different from Virtual Reality headset that created an immersive experience, Augmented Reality enable the player to remain in the real word and interact with virtual objects. For this project, I will use Microsoft Hololens as the display headset and Unity to program the game. \

\
<p style="text-align:center;">Also inspired by the sport dodgeball that player moving left and right to avoid hit. I want to combine it with the music aspect to create a game that the player needed to avoid hit by music note.\
</p>\
  \
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Research & Ideas </h2>\
\
  <p style="text-align:center;">For making this project, I did a little bit research to see what is possible. After learning the basic connection of Microsoft Hololens and Unity, I had a better understanding of the devices. Secondly, I research for the music visualizer, which can automatically generated waves/ object movement by inputting a song. I will use the music visualizer as the producer of the notes, so that when the notes will be fit with the song when generated. Moreover, I saw some very interesting augmented reality board game that used a target object and display the character on top. In this way, there will be not only the virtual objects, but also physical ones that player can actually move around, which can add more fun experience to the game. </p>\

 \
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Making Process</h2>\
  <h4 style="text-align:center;">Features:</h4>\
  <p style="text-align:center;">- Target dist for dancing player</p>\
  <p style="text-align:center;">- Target space for playing environment </p>\
  <p style="text-align:center;">- Music Visualizer for notes to generated </p>\
  <p style="text-align:center;">- Begin Scene & Game Over Scene </p>\
  \
  <h4 style="text-align:center;">Addtional Details:</h4>\
  <p style="text-align:center;">- Moving the dancing player dist to avoid hit by music notes</p>\
  <p style="text-align:center;">- 3 life in total ? (Maybe change)</p>\
  <p style="text-align:center;">- Score counting board : if the dancer is successfully avoid each note, the score go up. </p>\

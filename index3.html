  <p style="text-align:center;"> As the technology is developing, the era of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality is approaching. Different from Virtual Reality headset that created an immersive experience, Augmented Reality enable the player to remain in the real word and interact with all kinds of virtual objects. For this project, we want to explore the usability and functionality of Microsoft Hololens. Inspired by one of the most popular VR game \'97 Beat Saber and traditional spot game \'97 Dodge ball, we want to make a music board game in Augmented Reality. Dislike other Augmented Reality game that only develop within the headset, we want to add some physical components to enhance the user interact experience.</p>\
  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Making Process </h2>\

  <p style="text-align:center;"> For begin this project, I printed out some test copy to see what kind of pattern or image combination works better with the Vuforia image target. After finished with uploading the Vuforia database, I used a robot model from 10\'d710 project to demonstrate that the tracking is working.</p>\

  <p style="text-align:center;"> Then, we imported the animated character model into unity. After few changes, we were able to make the character dance on top of our tracking disc.</p>\

   <p style="text-align:center;"> Finally, we tested out the environment in unity and combine with the animated character. The final video will be a conceptual model of our music board game.</p>\

  <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Conclusion & Reflection</h2>\
     <p style="text-align:center;"> Combing music with the animated character, our music board game can provides the player more immersive experience with the game environment. Though out this project, we encountered many difficulties when deploying the game into the Microsoft Hololens. However, each problems that we ran into make us to learn more about the headset and the current issue it has for developers. We found out that through Unity play mode, we would able to see the model and environment through Microsoft Hololens. However, because Vuforia couldn\'92t be track in Unity through play mode, we need to export out the whole project in order to play it on Microsoft Hololen. But in Visual Studio we couldn\'92t located the project in the right path which is still a problem we are trying to figure out. For future, we will keep exploring different methods to deploy the game into the AR headset and try to make it functional.</p>\
